Codex is a static site generator powered by a bunch of cool Node.js
tools. I will be publish documentation soon. As well as some themes
as I get them going. Until then, here is what you need to know...

* Content is written in Markdown
* Templates are writen in Jade
* Styles are written in Stylus

### Starting a New Site

    npm install codex -g
    codex skeleton new-project
    cd new-project
    codex build

Enjoy!
